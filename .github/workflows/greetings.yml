          issue-message: |
            👋 Welcome, and thanks for opening your first issue in **namegen**!

            To help us move fast, please include:
            - What you expected vs what happened
            - The exact command you ran (flags/seed/mode/etc)
            - Your OS + Go version
            - Any error output or logs

            If you want to take a crack at a fix, the quick local sanity run is:
            `make ci`
            
            BUT you should run `make fuckmeup` for a full blown sanity check and cross platform build attempt

            Thanks again - we appreciate you.

            🎉 Thanks for your first pull request to **namegen**!

            Quick checklist before review:
            - [ ] `make ci` passes locally
            - [ ] If behavior changes, include an example command/output (seeded if relevant)
            - [ ] Keep output deterministic when `-s` is provided
            - [ ] Run `make fmt`

            A maintainer will take a look soon. Thanks for contributing!
